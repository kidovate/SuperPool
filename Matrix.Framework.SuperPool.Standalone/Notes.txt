*IMPORTANT*

This assembly combines all the files of SuperPool Framework together, in one assembly.
So if you wish to use the only the super framework in your solution, but do not wish 
to use all the Matrix Platform multiple assemblies, you can use this instead.

This is also why different files inside this project are places in different namespaces.

The only reference required along with this assembly is the PowerCollections Dll. If you
mandatorily need to only use one assembly, since include the source code of the PowerCollections
into this project (you can find it here: http://powercollections.codeplex.com/)
